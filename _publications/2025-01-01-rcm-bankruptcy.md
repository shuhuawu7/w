  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The soaring medical debt has become a pressing policy concern in the U.S. It is one of the leading causes for filing personal bankruptcy, with about 100 million Americans owing over $220 million in medical debt. We aim to understand the role hospital revenue cycle management (RCM) systems play in personal bankruptcy filings, while accounting for the regulatory environment as a contingency. This enterprise IT is designed to optimize institutional billing and reimbursement, yet how such operational efficiency translates into patient financial outcomes is theoretically ambiguous. Drawing on organizational information processing theory, we specifically examine whether RCM systems reduce or exacerbate personal bankruptcy filings and how state- level expansion of Medicaid insurance coverage moderates this relationship. Using a county-level panel dataset of 2,329 counties from 2013 to 2017, we find that counties with a higher rate of RCM adoption tend to exhibit fewer bankruptcy filings if the county is located in a state that has expanded Medicaid enrollment. However, this effect is not discernible in non-expansion counties. Furthermore, we conduct various mechanism tests and observe that RCM adoption is associated with higher insurance coverage rates, more affordable care, and reduced medical debt and loans. The results suggest that RCM systems provide financial protection and lower bankruptcy filings for low-income patients by connecting them with alternative payment options, streamlining insurance onboarding, and facilitating medical billing. This study extends the extant literature on medical debt by delving into the financial process within hospitals. Our findings shed light on the societal value of health IT by demonstrating how hospital financial technologies can promote not only organizational efficiency but also patient financial resilience. More broadly, we offer a novel perspective on the potential of digital health infrastructure to support financial inclusion and advance health equity in the U.S. healthcare system.</p>
